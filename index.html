					<h3><b>Analysis of the Plots</b></h3>
					<h4>The following correlations were determined if the demographics (x-axis) and 
						behavior risk (y-axis) have a correlation greater than 0.50 or less than -0.50. 
						2014 data was retrieved from <a href=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml>
						American FactFinder</a> and <a href=https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq>
						Behaviorial Risk Factor Surveillance System</a>.

					in states with a lower reported percentage of individuals in the labor force as 
					a higher percentage of depression and vice versa.</p>

					<p><b>In the Labor Force v. Used the Internet in the last 30 days: </b>
					The graph shows a positive correlation of around 0.54. A lower reported rate of
					individuals in the labor force also has a lower percentage of indiivduals who went
					on the Internet in 30 days before completing the survey.</p>

					The graph shows a negative correlation of around -0.676. A higher reported rate of 
					poverty has a lower percentage of indiivduals who went on the Internet in 30 days 
					before completing the survey and vice versa. For example, Mississippi has the highest 
					percentage of respondents in poverty (18.9%) and lowest Internet usage (61.6%). On the
					other hand, New Hampshire has the lowest percentage of respondents (8.16%) and one of 
					higher percentage of Internet usage (83.1)%.</p>
